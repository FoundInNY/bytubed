		                </p>
		                <p>
		                    A: BYTubeD stands for "Bulk YouTube video Downloader" (or "Batch YouTube video Downloader").
		                    It is a <a href="https://adddons.mozilla.org/addon/bytubed/" rel="nofollow">Firefox extension</a>
		                    that helps users in downloading YouTube videos in bulk (i.e., downloading multiple YouTube
		                    videos at once in batch mode with a few clicks). It can be used to download all/selected YouTube
		                    videos on any page which has some YouTube video links. It makes the job of downloading YouTube
		                    playlists easy.

		                <p>
		                    A: 1.0.7

		                    <strong>Q: How do I invoke BYTubeD?</strong>
		                </p>
		                <p>
		                    A: There are atleast 2 ways to invoke BYTubeD:
			                <ul>
			                    <li>
			                        Right click and then click on BYTubeD
			                    </li>
			                    <li>
			                        Click on the Tools -&gt; BYTubeD menu item
			                    </li>
			                </ul>
		                </p>
		                <p>
		                    <strong>Q: How do I select the videos to download?</strong>
		                </p>
		                <p>
		                    A: Either enter an appropriate selection filter in the Selection Filter
		                    field, or select the titles manually by holding Ctrl key while selecting
		                    the individual titles.
		                </p>
		                <p>
		                    <strong>Q: How can select all the videos for download?</strong>
		                </p>
		                <p>
		                    A: There are at least two options:
		                </p>
		                <ul>
		                    <li>
		                        By pressing Ctrl+A
		                    </li>
		                    <li>
		                        By checking the "Select All" check box near the Start button.
		                    </li>
		                </ul>
		                <p>
		                    <strong>Q: How does the selection filter work?</strong>
		                </p>
		                <p>
		                    A: The selection filter understands 
		                    <a href="http://www.javascriptkit.com/javatutors/redev2.shtml" rel="nofollow">
		                        JavaScript regular expressions
		                   	</a>.
		                    If you are not familiar with JavaScript regular expressions, just enter
		                    some text and all the titles that have this text as a substring will be
		                    selected. In case you don't understand this substring business, the
		                    easiest option is to select the videos manually.
		                </p>
		                <p>
		                    <strong>Q: I have selected the videos to be downloaded. Then what?</strong>
		                </p>
		                <p>
		                    A: Click "Start" or press ENTER.
		                </p>
		                <p>
		                    <strong>Q: Ok! Then what happens?</strong>
		                </p>
		                <p>
		                    A: Depending on the value of the "What to do?" field, BYTubeD will either start generating video links
		                    or it will start enqueueing the requested videos into Firefox's Downloads window. Once the process of
		                    enqueueing/generating is completed, the Downloads window or the generated links window will popup. Now
		                    you can close the BYTubeD queueing status window, if it is still open.
		                </p>
		                <p>
		                    <strong>Q: Can I use a download manager like DownThemAll to better manage my
		                    downloads?</strong>
		                </p>
		                <p>
		                    A: Yes! Starting from version 1.0.4, BYTubeD provides a way of using
		                    your favorite download managers to better manage downloads.
		                </p>
		                <p>
		                    <strong>Q: How do I use my favorite download manager with BYTubeD?</strong>
		                </p>
		                <p>
		                    A: On the selection window (i.e., the first window that you see when you
		                    invoke BYTubeD), select "Generate Links" for "What to do?". Now when you
		                    say Start, BYTubeD will generate all the downloadable video links in a
		                    new window, where you can invoke your favorite download manager.

	                                If you choose "Enqueue for Download", then BYTubeD will directly enqueue
	                                the download requests in to the default Downloads window of Firefox.
	                                This is a very basic option and not quite recommended.

	                                links to downloadable videos as an HTML page, where you can invoke a
	                                download manager like DownThemAll. This option is much better, because
	                                with this you will have lot more control over the downloads than
	                                otherwise.

		                    <strong>Q: What does MP4 &gt; FLV mean?</strong>
		                </p>
		                <p>
		                    A: (By the way, if you are seeing "MP4 &gt; FLV" on your BYTubeD window,
		                    you are using an older version. Please get the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/bytubed/" rel="nofollow">new
		                    version</a>.) Any
		                    way, MP4 &gt; FLV means that you would like to download the videos in MP4
		                    format if they are available in MP4 format. If they are not available in
		                    MP4 format, then BYTubeD will try to fetch them in FLV format.
		                </p>
		                <p>
		                    <strong>Q: I don't want to see too many error report requests. Can I suppress
		                    them?</strong>
		                </p>
		                <p>
		                    A: Yes. Go to Preferences -&gt; User Interaction; and check the "Suppress
		                    error messages..." checkbox.
		                </p>
		                <p>
		                    <strong>Q: I am not able to download certain videos with BYTubeD. It says
		                    "Embedding disabled by request. Watch on YouTube". What should I do?</strong>
		                </p>
		                <p>
		                    A: Please get the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/bytubed" rel="nofollow">latest version</a>.
		                    With the latest version you can download almost any YouTube video.
